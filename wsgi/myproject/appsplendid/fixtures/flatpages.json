The dealer turns\r\nthe centre card and shouts \"Splendid\".<br/>\r\nEach player looks for a matching symbol (or words) on their top card which matches the centre card.\r\nWhen they find one they must shout the symbol as they put it on top of the centre pile. </p>\r\n<img src=\"/static/appsplendid/SplendidDoodleIcons_by_bmsleight_17.png\">\r\n<p><b>\"July 4th\"</b></p>\r\n<p>This card placed becomes the new card everyone must now try and match. If the person does not shout the\r\nname they will not be allowed to place the card.
